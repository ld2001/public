The following are code samples of mine from a combination of classes and personal projects. Please don't hesitate to email: lukeding3@gmail.com for further questions or clarifications. All code should be considered open source, and free to use.

A summary of the code folders can be found below:
	Typing Speed- The is a programming assignment done in C to test the user's typing speed. 
	Floating Point- The floating point program is done in C, and allows the user to enter a number of bits, fracs, and hex values, and returns the corresponding floating point value (in decimal).
	Queue & Stack- This program is written in C++, and was done as a side project. I grew tired of having to write lists and nodes for various Queue/LL/Stack applications. Decided to build a super structure to allow users to push/pop, enqueue/dequeue, in-order-insert, all using one basic code set. Can be run as a program, but really is meant as code base.
	Hospital Simulation- This program simulates a priority queue, and is written in C++. 

In-progress/Upcoming:
	Visual Scripting Language (Unreal 4 & C++)- Developing a visual scripting language in 3D/VR, to allow users to connect visual objects for programming, instead of learning to type. Currently have UI, object spawn & connect, and grab functionality built. Currently working code interaction. Expected completion Q1 2019. Please reach out if curious!
