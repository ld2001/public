The following are code samples of mine from a combination of classes and personal projects. Please don't hesitate to email: lukeding3@gmail.com for further questions or clarifications. All code should be considered open source, and free to use.

A summary of the code folders can be found below:
	Typing Speed- The is a programming assignment done in C to test the user's typing speed. 
	Floating Point- The floating point program is done in C, and allows the user to enter a number of bits, fracs, and hex values, and returns the corresponding floating point value (in decimal).
	Queue & Stack- This program is written in C++, and was done as a side project. I grew tired of having to write lists and nodes for various Queue/LL/Stack applications. Decided to build a super structure to allow users to push/pop, enqueue/dequeue, in-order-insert, all using one basic code set. Can be run as a program, but really is meant as code base.
	Hospital Simulation- This program simulates a priority queue, and is written in C++. 

In-progress/Upcoming:
	Visual Scripting Language (Unreal 4 & C++)- Developing a visual scripting language in 3D/VR, to allow users to connect visual objects for programming, instead of learning to type. Currently have UI, object spawn & connect, and grab functionality built. Actual language interactions between objects comes Q1 2019. 
	
	Edit- Final version compiled. Presentation also loaded.
	
	Copy of latest exe can be downloaded here:

	Instructions:
		Move Around (WASD)
		Pick-up Objects (Move to, and press F)
		Link two objects (Press left mouse key while pointed at object 1, point at object 2 and release mouse key)
		Spawn Objects (Click 1 key, then mouse click the first or second menu object)
		Type- Hit insert, then enter.
